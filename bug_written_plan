## Crashing Bugs 


##Reseting Puzzle Pieces
 
-Select the div with class Puzzle-pieces;
-Reset the drop-zone;
-Reset puzzle-board;
-Change the puzzle-pieces src;
-Add the puzzle-board with the new puzzle-pieces.

##Do not add  more than 1 picture in the same spot:

- Check the Console to check where the pictures are being dropped;
- Check the ChildElement; 
- BUG: If I drop the image inside the drop zone - the validation works;
- If I drop the image on the top of another image - the validation does not work;
- FIX: Create an IF saying: If the childElement/target is 0 and not an image then, allow dropping.
