## Crashing Bugs 


##Reseting Puzzle Pieces
 
-Selected the div with class Puzzle-pieces
-Reseted the dropzone
-Reseted puzzle-board
-Changed the puzzle-pieces src
-Adding the puzzle-board with the new puzzle-pieces;

##Do not add the more than 1 picture in the same spot:

Check console to check where the pictures are being dropped;
Check the ChildElement; 
BUG: If I drop the image inside the drop zone - the validation works
If I drop the image on the top of another image - the validation does not work. 
- Create a IF saying : If the childelement/target is 0 and not an image then, allow dropping.
